Here is the control (moderation) protocol definition.
All commands will be packed in the data object as a string called "cmd", optionally a "msg" can be implemented later to send messages to the other participants.


VIEW (RIGTH|LEFT) n
 Change the RIGHT or LEFT main image frame to show stream of user n

KICK n
 User n must leave the room, note this is an unsecure command as the user is not forced to leave and/or close the streams
 subscription.
 
VOLUME n (ON|OFF)
 Mute or unmute the sound from the stream of user n, if the client is user n it mutes audio on the local stream.
 Note the clients mute also the receiving stream so no malicious or comunication failure will take practical effects.
 The use of command VOLUME instead of 'MUTE' allows future implementation to add the option of numerical setting instead
 of ON/OFF switch.
